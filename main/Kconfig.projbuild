config ENABLE_DISPLAY
    bool "Enable RGB display bring-up"
    default y
    help
        Control initialization of the RGB display pipeline. Disable only for
        headless diagnostics; the UI manager expects a display in normal
        builds.

config ENABLE_TOUCH
    bool "Enable GT911 touch controller"
    default y
    help
        Allow GT911 touch controller initialization and LVGL input device
        registration. Disable to skip touch bring-up at boot.

config ENABLE_SDCARD
    bool "Enable microSD (external storage)"
    default n
    help
        Enable initialization and mounting of the external microSD card.
        Disable to skip any SD card probing and boot without external
        storage access.

config I2C_SCAN_AT_BOOT
    bool "Scan shared I2C bus at boot"
    default n
    help
        If enabled, probe all addresses on the shared I2C bus during boot
        for diagnostics.

config UI_SMOKE_MODE
    bool "Enable LVGL smoke-test overlay"
    default y
    help
        When enabled, create a simple LVGL overlay with a centered label
        ("LVGL OK") to validate the render pipeline independently of the
        full application UI. Intended for bring-up and diagnostics; can be
        disabled in production builds.
